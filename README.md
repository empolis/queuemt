# QueueMT
An open-source tool for managing kafka brokers and clusters.


## Inspiration üöÄ

To be able to do some manual testing during the development of our __big data analytics__ projects, we needed a tool to manage our Kafka brokers, reading/writing messages from/to the Topics of our Kafka clusters. No tool met our needs, so we decided to develop one ourselves.


## Features üß∞

* Configuration of the Kafka Broker / Cluster via the user interface.
* Overview of the Kafka Cluster
* Listing of:
  * partitions
  * consumers
  * consumer groups
  * topics
  * settings
* Reading/writing messages from/to Topics
* import and export of requests
* support of authentication via:
  * username / password
